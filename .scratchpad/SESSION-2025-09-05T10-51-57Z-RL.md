# Session Notes (Evolutionary RL)
- Time: 2025-09-05T10:51:57Z
- Action: train_roles.js (GENS=16), role+weights co-evolution
- Output: result/ai.txt (6 tanks, NN controller 16→6→5)
- Roles: [TANKER, DEALER, TANKER, DEALER, NORMAL, TANKER] (internal [1,2,1,2,0,1])
- Validation: baseline 50 matches → 50-0-0, avgEndTick ≈ 276.8
- Next: increase GENS to 24–32, diversify seeds/opponent pool, mirror matches
