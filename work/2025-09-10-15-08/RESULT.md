Approach
- Predictive aim: quadratic intercept with smoothed velocity and capped lead time.
- Threat avoidance: candidate-angle scoring using closest-approach distance and time-to-approach; edge penalty and center bias.
- Range control: role-tuned rMin/rMax with adaptive aggression for finishers and when enemy count thins.
- Separation: soft repulsion from nearest ally to reduce pathing conflicts.
- Jitter: subtle aim jitter to avoid being perfectly predictable.
- Roles: 2 Tankers frontline, 2 Dealers flanks, 2 Normals mid.

Notes
- Did not modify tank_battle_platform.html.
- .agent/SIMULATOR.md followed; used headless engine parity with HTML rules.
- Nova v2 (side-opening) underperformed asymmetrically and was not published.
