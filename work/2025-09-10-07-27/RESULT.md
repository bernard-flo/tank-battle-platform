Notes:
- Composition: 1 Tanker (front), 5 Dealers (spread bias).
- Tactics: predictive aim (VM-persistent), bullet NA dodge, edge + ally separation, strafe ring, and kill-secure aggression when targets are low HP or enemies are few.
- The same code runs in tank_battle_platform.html (stateless fallback without VM persistence).
