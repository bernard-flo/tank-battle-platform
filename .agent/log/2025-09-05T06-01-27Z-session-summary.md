# Session Summary

- Engine config aligned to HTML (energy/size/speed/damage).
- Trained with train2 (12 gens). Best vs baseline: 10/10 wins.
- Selfplay eval (50 matches): 50W-0L-0D, avgEndTick≈505.8.
- Output updated: result/ai.txt (6 NN tanks; import-ready).

How to import in UI:
- Open tank_battle_platform.html → RED/BLUE 팀 Import 버튼 → result/ai.txt 내용을 그대로 붙여넣기.
- 각 팀에 동일 번들을 넣어도 되며, 팀명을 입력 후 Start.

Next steps (planned):
- Run train_roles for role+weights co-evolution with higher GENS.
- Diversify opponent pool (mirror, randomized seeds) for robustness.
