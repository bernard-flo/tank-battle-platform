Goal: Create a winning script for the tank_battle_platform.html AI competition by outperforming existing solutions.

Process:
* Create a Timestamped Workspace: In the work/ directory, create a new folder named with the output string of the `date +%F-%H-%M` command.
* Analyze, Benchmark, and Iterate: Thoroughly analyze the strategies and code of all competitor scripts within the result/ directory. Use this analysis to inform and improve your own script's logic. Continuously simulate your developing script against all competitors, refining it until it consistently outperforms them.
* Final Deliverables:
  * Script File: Save your finally developed script to the result/ directory. The file must be a .txt compatible with the platform, and its name must match the timestamped workspace folder.
  * Comparison Report: In your workspace folder, create a RESULT.md file that documents the final performance metrics and proves its superiority over the other results.

Simulation Args:
* Repeat: 10
* Sedd: 1
* Concurrency: 4
