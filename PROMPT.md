Create high-performance code for an AI code competition that runs on `tank_battle_platform.html`.

Create a directory using the output string of the `date +%F-%H-%M` command in `work/` directory and perform the work within it.
The final output should be in a format that can be imported by `tank_battle_platform.html` and inside the `result/` directory with the same name as the working directory.

You must simulate against other results in the `result/` directory to produce a more superior outcome.
Iterate until you create a result that outperforms the other results in the result directory.

Save the comparison results of the final output to `RESULT.md` in your working directory.
